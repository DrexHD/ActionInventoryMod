## Give Action
Give actions give players items (other stuff in the future).

They look like:
```
{
  ...common fields...
  "itemsToGive": []
}
```
(common fields are specified in [[Actions v3]])

## Items To Give (defaults to nothing)
These are the items that are given to the player. This is an array of objects. See [[Items v3]].
