## Group Action
Group actions execute other actions.

They look like:
```
{
  ...common fields...
  "actions": []
}
```
(common fields are specified in [[Actions v3]])

## Actions (defaults to nothing)
These are the actions that are executed when this action is executed. This is an array of objects. See [[Action v3]].
