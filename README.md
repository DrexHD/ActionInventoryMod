# ActionInventoryMod (v3)
**This is a server only mod** (works on both dedicated and single player servers)


A Fabric Minecraft mod that allows the creation of special inventories that can do different things when items are clicked.

There are three main things added: openers (which open action inventories), action inventories, and action elements (the things in the inventories). Action elements are displayed as items stacks and execute actions when clicked.

Checkout the wiki on how to create the inventories and for specifics on what can be done.

This mod is similar to the [Chest Commands](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/chest-commands) bukkit plugin.
