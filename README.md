# ActionInventoryMod
**This is a server only mod** (works on both dedicated and single player servers)


A Fabric Minecraft mod that allows the creation of special inventories that can do different things when items are clicked.

An ActionInventory is composed of Openers (which say when the invventory should open) and ActionItems (displayed as ItemStacks). ActionItems are composed of requirements (which determine whether a player can view or use an ActionItem) and Actions (which do things such as executing commands and giving items).

Checkout the wiki on how to create the inventories and for specifics on what can be done.


This mod is similar to the [Chest Commands](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/chest-commands) bukkit plugin.
